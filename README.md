# Personal website / portfolio

This project is a personal website / portfolio. With this project I want to experiment a bit more with CSS and HTML and designing a website in general.
For this project I chose to use Sass for the first time to make it easier to organize and read my CSS code. 

The website contains a few subsections:
- Home: this part of the page has moving shapes, my name and a few links to my profiles.
- About: this part of the page talks about my skills and interests.
- Projects: this part of the page shows a few of my projects and links to my GitHub profile. In the future I might create an API that allows me to quickly
  add or remove projects from this section.
- Contact: this part of the page will contain a few contact details. I might remove this part.

## Organization
The repository contains a few different directories.
- `scss` contains all the scss files, these are all processed to form the `style.css` file.
- `images` contains all the images used, however vector images (svg) are directly implemented into the `index.html` file.
